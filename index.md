## My Professional Pursuits 
I'm a Cognitive Science student with a specializaton in Machine Learning and Neural Computation at UC San Diego (Class of Spring 2024)! 

I'm an aspiring software engineer. This past Summer I interned as a software engineer at BlackRock on the Cloud Engineering/Governance Team. Last Summer, I was awared a $5,000 computer science research scholarship to build a solution for deleveloping confidence in young women. I developed GEM - the video game for growth mindset development. In past years, I was the Director of Product at Novelly - EdTech NonProfit Publisher. At Novelly, I launched their principal product - a progressive web application that houses a library of 70+ youth-written stories on social issues and a community platform of 300+ social changemakers.

## My Personal Pursuits
In my free time, I pursue my passion for the performing and visual arts. I'm a pageant title holder, 20x benefit concert vocalist, acapella vocalist, 4x musical lead and acrobat, fashion design and photography honoree, and national gymnatics title holder. 

`Shan = "Fitness Lover!"` If I'm not pursing the performing arts, you'll probably find me at the gym weightlifting (My deadlift PR is 255lbs), soul cycling, doing pilates or yoga, or walking my puppy, [Prune](https://www.instagram.com/brunomars_serafin/)! 

    Here are some personal goals I have for myself!
    - [] Act in a show or movie
    - [] Write and produce my own song
    - [] Get my Personal Trainer Certification

## My Mindset
**I always show up ready to get better than the day before.** In all aspects of my life, I focus on small and consistent hard work for long-term improvement. I genuinely believe there is nothing I can't accomplish with a good learning attitude and supportive environment. I feel extremely privileged to pursue my passions.
